ðŸ§  Deep Learning Practice

This repository contains my personal journey into deep learning, from foundational concepts like perceptrons to applied neural network models using NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow/Keras.

ðŸš€ Topics Plan

  Shallow neural network (Perceptrons)

  Activation functions and loss functions

  Forward and backward propagation

  Optimisers

  Regularisation

  CNNs and image data

  RNNs and sequence modeling

  Autoencoders

  GANs

  Transformers architecture

  Transfer learning and pretrained models

  Fine-tuning and deployment

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

    Python

    NumPy

    scikit-learn

    PyTorch (main framework)

    Keras/TensorFlow (for comparisons)

ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To internalise deep learning concepts through code, experiments, and theory â€” with an emphasis on hands-on learning and gradually building toward production-level skills.
